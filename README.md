# ANDROID MOVIES APP

## Project Overview
Android movies is an app that allow users to discoverthe movies they want to play.

This app uses the API from [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

## What I learned
- Fetch data from the Internet with theMovieDB API
- Use adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views
- Incorporate libraries to simplify the amount of code you need to write
- Build a fully featured application that looks and feels natural on the latest Android operating system.
